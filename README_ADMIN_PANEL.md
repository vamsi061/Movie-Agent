# Movie Agent Admin Panel

## Overview
The Movie Agent Admin Panel allows you to manage and configure all movie search agents in the system. You can enable/disable individual agents, view statistics, and control which agents are used for movie searches.

## Features

### üéõÔ∏è Agent Management
- **Toggle Individual Agents**: Enable or disable specific agents with toggle switches
- **Bulk Operations**: Enable or disable all agents at once
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes are applied immediately without server restart
- **Visual Status**: Clear visual indicators for enabled/disabled agents

### üìä Statistics Dashboard
- **Total Agents**: View the total number of available agents
- **Enabled/Disabled Count**: See how many agents are currently active
- **Agent Details**: View descriptions and current status of each agent

### üîß Available Agents
1. **Enhanced DownloadHub Agent** - Searches and extracts download links from DownloadHub
2. **MoviezWap Agent** - Searches and extracts download links from MoviezWap
3. **MovieRulz Agent** - Searches and extracts download links from MovieRulz
4. **SkySetX Agent** - Searches and extracts download links from SkySetX
5. **Telegram Movie Agent** - Searches movies through Telegram channels

## How to Access

### Method 1: Direct URL
1. Start the web server: `python3 web_interface.py`
2. Open your browser to: `http://localhost:8080/admin`

### Method 2: From Main Interface
1. Start the web server: `python3 web_interface.py`
2. Go to the main page: `http://localhost:8080`
3. Click the "Admin Panel" link in the top-right corner

## How It Works

### Configuration Management
- Agent settings are stored in `agent_config.json`
- Changes are persisted automatically
- The system uses the `AgentManager` class to handle all agent operations

### Agent Initialization
- Only enabled agents are initialized and loaded into memory
- Disabled agents are completely bypassed during movie searches
- Changes take effect immediately without requiring a server restart

### Search Behavior
When you search for movies:
- Only **enabled** agents will be used for searching
- Disabled agents will be completely skipped
- This allows you to control which sources are searched

## Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Disable Slow Agents
If certain agents are slow or unreliable:
1. Go to Admin Panel
2. Toggle off the problematic agents
3. Continue using only the fast, reliable agents

### Scenario 2: Test New Agents
When testing or debugging:
1. Disable all agents except the one you want to test
2. Run searches to isolate behavior
3. Re-enable other agents when done

### Scenario 3: Maintenance Mode
During maintenance:
1. Use "Disable All Agents" to stop all searches
2. Perform maintenance tasks
3. Use "Enable All Agents" to restore service

## Security Note
The admin panel should only be accessible to authorized users. In a production environment, consider adding authentication and access controls.
