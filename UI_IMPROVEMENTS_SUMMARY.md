## 🤖 LLM Agent Fixes

### Problem Solved
When users asked for movie recommendations like "I want to watch something exciting and action-packed", the LLM was responding with a written list of movies in text format, duplicating what was already displayed in the structured UI.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Updated `llm_chat_agent.py`
- Modified system prompt to explicitly instruct: **"DO NOT list individual movies in your response"**
- Changed response approach to provide guidance and commentary instead of movie lists
- Updated fallback suggestions to avoid duplication

#### 2. Updated `enhanced_llm_chat_agent.py`
- Applied same fix to the enhanced chat agent
- Improved prompts to focus on encouraging commentary about search results
- Better context awareness for movie recommendations

### Before vs After

#### Before (❌):
```
Response: "Here are some great action movies for you:
• Avengers Endgame (2019) - 1080p
• John Wick (2014) - 720p
• Mission Impossible (2018) - HD
..."
```

#### After (✅):
```
Response: "Great! I found some exciting action-packed movies for you! 
Check out the results below - they include different qualities and sources. 
You might find some great superhero movies or high-stakes thrillers. 
Would you like me to search for any specific sub-genre of action movies?"
```
